# London Assistant App @VanilStorm
Application concept: an application that will help you find a vehicle in London: metro, bicycles and buses. In my opinion, the most necessary :)

A Google map with the exact opposition of certain vehicles will be provided
It will also be possible to find and find out the approximate time before the arrival of the bus: To do this, you need to know the number line game, the destination, direction and approximate arrival time will be shown.
It will also be possible to use a filter for a specific search.

## In order to start using it , you will need to log in.

Username: 'admin'
Password: 'admin1'

## VPN
Also, for the correct display of data, people living in CIS countries should use a good VPN.
Since the API is not available for these countries.
